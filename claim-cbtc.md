To claim your CBTC, please download the corresponding wallet archive file.

Follow the instructions to set up the wallet, then open it and allow it to sync.

Next, you will have to insert your private key. For your safety, we recommend moving your BTC and/or ZCL to a NEW ADDRESS before importing.

Go to wallet > import one private key and enter the private key. It will ask if you want to sweep, for security reasons, you should press yes.

Your Classic Bitcoin should be claimed now!
